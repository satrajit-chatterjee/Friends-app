# Friends
A post retirement Lifestyle, Social Media, Community and Companionship App

## Objective:

To make a social media app for senior citizens that would create a community solely for them. The app would allow elder people to meet up, organize events, etc.

The other aspect of the app would allow senior citizens to connect with the younger generation who would provide companionship services for a fee. They would come and spend time with them and interact socially by various activities like playing cards, sharing stories, etc according to common hobbies and interests.

## Our Dream:

Our society has a problem today. All around the world, as people grow older, a large percentage of the society suffers from a loss of a friend circle and isolation because of a number of factors. As loved ones grow up, and move out senior citizens are often left to live alone.

This project aims to solve this problem and empower our senior citizens through the Friends app. With a focus on ease of use, Friends will consist of two parts.

The first part is about giving personalised companionship to elders who want to spend time with our special companionship experts hired through the app. These companionship experts will be young people especially college going students, who are looking to make pocket money. These people already opt for things like tutoring, etc. We would be creating another market for them to explore and find their interests in. Senior citizens would be able to match with these companionship experts based on common interests and hobbies.

The second part would consist of a social media platform where eldees will be able to connect with other elders in their vicinity based on common interests etc and organize meet-ups, events, etc with their growing friend circle. The app would facilitate organizing vacations, events, meet-ups, etc all assisted by our companionship experts if they wish their assistance.

With a special focus on ensuring a healthy community, companionship experts would be subjected to an innovative and simple background check to prevent identity theft and ensure the safety of our users.

With a rating system for everything on the app, all users would be able to ensure that they meet up and match with people they know they will like to spend time with.

Through Friends, post retirement life will be something to look forward to. No longer is retirement loneliness and isolation. It's actually the fun and adventure you imagined it would be. It's an opportunity to rediscover yourself in a whole new way.

## What we are building :

In order to demonstrate the core features of matching with nearby companionship experts and senior citizens we are currently working on a prototype of the app.

The prototype will focus on the companionship services and consist of a user friendly account creation, background check features, payment setup and matching service based on common interests, availability, etc along with the ability to request help for account creation and by anyone you choose alongside chat and call options and making appointments with matched companionship experts (CEs).

In the prototype we plan to focus on the CE services.

## The Future :

Friends is an app where we are committed to completing, getting feature complete and production ready by March 2019. According to studies made by our team members, we have seen that there is a high demand for this service across the world. As smartphone penetration increases in this age group, this app will become more and more relevant for aged widows, widowers, those who have moved to a new place, or simply wanting to connect with like minded individuals to spend time with and go on vacations after retirement.
